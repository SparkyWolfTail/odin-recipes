    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza, a culinary delight, has evolved from its Italian origins into a worldwide phenomenon. It starts with a yeasted flatbread, topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then baked. This simple base has spawned countless variations, accommodating a vast array of toppings to suit diverse tastes. The adaptability of pizza allows for culinary experimentation, making it a favorite among food enthusiasts and a staple across cultures.</p>
    <p>Originating in 18th century Naples as a meal for the working class, pizza's popularity soared following Queen Margherita's endorsement, with the Margherita pizza showcasing the colors of the Italian flag. Today, from Neapolitan to Chicago and New York styles, pizza reflects regional flavors and traditions. Its global appeal stems from its delicious simplicity, uniting people across different backgrounds in their shared love for this versatile dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>11 cup of warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Dough: </b>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5-10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li><b>Preheat the Oven: </b>Preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically between 450째F (230째C) and 500째F (260째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat as well.</li>
        <li><b>3. Shape the Dough: </b>Punch down the risen dough on a floured surface. Divide it if you want to make smaller pizzas. Stretch or roll out the dough into a round shape, about 12 inches in diameter. Place it on a piece of parchment paper for easy transfer.</li>
        <li><b>Add Toppings: </b>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the Pizza: </b>Transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Carefully remove the pizza from the oven.</li>        
        <li><b>Serve: </b>Let the pizza cool for a few minutes, then garnish with fresh basil, if using, and season with red pepper flakes or oregano as desired. Slice and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
